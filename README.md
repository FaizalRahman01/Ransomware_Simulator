# **Ransomware Simulator**
## **Summary**
**Ransomware Simulator** is a cross-platform educational project designed to demonstrate the **behavior**, **design**, and **mechanism** of modern ransomware in a controlled and ethical environment.  
The project showcases **real-world ransomware functionalities**, including **targeted file encryption** and **decryption**, while maintaining a clear boundary for **cybersecurity training** and **awareness purposes**.

---

## **Key Components of the Project**

- **Android Ransomware APK (Disguised as Spotify):**  
  Simulates ransomware behavior on Android devices by **encrypting a predefined file** using **AES-256 CBC encryption**.  
  Includes a separate **Decryptor APK** to safely reverse the process using the correct password.

- **Windows Ransomware EXE (Disguised as CapCut):**  
  Provides the same simulation for Windows environments, **encrypting all files within a specific directory** and generating **.encrypted** file extensions.  
  A separate **Decryptor EXE** allows safe restoration.

- **AES-256 CBC Encryption:**  
  Both platforms implement robust **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** with **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)** mode, paired with **SHA-256 for password hashing** to ensure secure simulation.

- **Controlled File Targeting:**  
  Encryption and decryption are **limited to specific folders or files**, minimizing unintended damage and focusing on demonstration.

- **Disguised UI and File Naming:**  
  Real-world mimicry through branding like **Spotify (Android)** and **CapCut (Windows)** to raise awareness about **social engineering tactics** in ransomware attacks.

## **Disclaimer**

This simulator is intended strictly for **ethical**, **educational**, and **cybersecurity awareness** purposes, helping **learners**, **researchers**, and **professionals** understand how ransomware operates **without causing real harm**.

# **CapCut.exe (Windows File Encryptor)**

This component is a Python-based ransomware encryptor disguised as CapCut.exe. It is designed for educational use to demonstrate how ransomware encrypts files using AES-256 encryption. The program encrypts files in a specified folder or a specific file and deletes the original version.

## **Overview**

| **Property** | **Details** |
|--------------|--------------|
| **File Name** | CapCut.exe (created from Python script) |
| **Language** | Python |
| **Encryption Type** | AES-256 (CBC Mode) |
| **Password** | "Faizal200@123" |
| **Output Extension** | .encrypted |
| **Platform** | Windows |
| **Compiled Using** | PyInstaller |

## **How It Works â€“ Step-by-Step**

### **Step 1: Define Target Path**

```python
file_to_encrypt = r"C:\Important_File"  # File or Folder path

### **Step 2: Generate AES-256 Key**

A 256-bit encryption key is generated using SHA-256 from the given password:

```python
def get_aes_key(password):
    hasher = SHA256.new(password.encode())
    return hasher.digest()
This ensures consistent and strong encryption.

### **Step 3: Encrypt File Content**

For each file:
- The file is read.
- Data is padded to fit AES block size.
- A random IV is generated.
- Data is encrypted using AES in CBC mode.
- The IV is added to the beginning of the encrypted file.

```python
iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
encrypted_data = iv + cipher.encrypt(padded_data)
The encrypted file is saved as:
